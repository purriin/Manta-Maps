# Manta Maps

Created for our ECE297 Software Design and Communication course. 

Applies StreetsDatabase, OSM, EZGL, and GTK APIs to create a mapping software. Utilizes the greedy algorithm, multithreading, A* algorithm with euclidean distance heuristic, and permutations for randomization for pathfinding and solving the traveling salesman problem.
